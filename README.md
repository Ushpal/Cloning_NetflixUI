To observe the results of the cloned code, follow these steps:

>  Open the terminal and execute the following command to install the necessary dependencies:    npm install
  
  
>  Once the installation is complete, start the application by running the following command in the terminal:    npm start

  
   By executing these commands, you will install the required Node.js dependencies and initiate the application. Make sure to review any console output or logs for 
   potential errors or additional instructions during the installation and execution processes.
  
   Please note that the success of these steps depends on the specific project and its configuration. Ensure that your environment meets any prerequisites mentioned 
   in the project's documentation.
